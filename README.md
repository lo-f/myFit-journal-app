 # myFit Journal App
myFit: a basic journaling CRUD app using MEN stack. It allows users to log or edit three kinds of workouts including run, weightlifting, walk to keep track of their physical activity. Users can also see other users' workouts but cannot edit or delete them.

## Getting Started
Visit [myFit](https://myfit-journal-app-f1d5b35a8543.herokuapp.com/) and sign up to log your first workout! The app uses basic authentication.
